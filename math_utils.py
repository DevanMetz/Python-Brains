"""
This module is currently empty.

The geometric utility functions for line-circle intersection
(e.g., `vectorized_line_circle_intersection`) were removed during the
refactoring to a simpler, grid-based simulation model. The new model
uses a unified ray-marching approach on a grid, and the complex
geometric calculations are no longer necessary.
