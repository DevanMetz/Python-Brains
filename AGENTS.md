# Agent Directives

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for any AI agent working on this project.

## 1. Code Verification
All new code or modifications to existing code must be accompanied by corresponding tests. All tests must pass before the code is considered complete.

## 2. Visual Feature Verification
Any changes that affect the visual output of the application must be verified with screenshots. The screenshot should clearly demonstrate the new feature or change.

## 3. Documentation
A living "Software Design Specification" document is maintained in `DESIGN.md`. Any agent making changes to the architecture, core mechanics, or overall design of the project **must** update this document to reflect those changes. The goal is to keep the documentation in sync with the state of the codebase.
