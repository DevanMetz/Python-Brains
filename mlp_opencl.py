"""
Provides an OpenCL-based implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

This module contains the `MLPOpenCL` class, which is designed to be a
drop-in replacement for the NumPy or CuPy MLP implementations. It offloads
the computationally expensive forward pass to the GPU using the OpenCL
standard, making it compatible with a wide range of hardware, including
NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.

    An MLP that uses OpenCL for GPU-accelerated forward passes.

    This implementation is highly optimized to minimize CPU-GPU data transfers.
    It performs the entire multi-layer forward pass on the GPU by using a
    "ping-pong" strategy with two pre-allocated buffers for all layer activations.
    This avoids the overhead of creating new buffers or copying intermediate
    results back to the CPU for each layer.

    Inherits from the base MLP class to reuse the weight/bias initialization
